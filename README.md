# My Test of Flutter

I'm learning how to use Flutter. 
Therefore, I've tried to test 3 widgets or packages per week which were described in [this YouTube Series from the Flutter team](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local directory.
2. `cd` to this repository's directory and run

```sh
flutter pub get
```
3. run it (You can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to test it.)

4. Or you might see its demo on [https://ychsue.github.io/my_flutter_test/](https://ychsue.github.io/my_flutter_test/).
